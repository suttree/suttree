### 👋 &ensp;I'm a maker and sometime digital art therapist. I lead teams who make products that people love, and create discrete, emotionally intelligent machines for your haus.


🤔 &ensp;I've been a technical Director at Analog Folk, Head of Digital at The Moon Festival, a Tech Lead at the V&A, a CTO and co-founder at Somewhere.com, a Creative Technologist at Made by Many, a CTO and co-founder at GameLayers, a games developer at 3rd Sense, an Analyst Programmer at UpMyStreet, and a junior developer at SelfTrade.

🧐 &ensp;I speak javascript, ruby, python, perl, java, C#, C, and, er, COBOL. Years ago I learned to code on graph paper, through the mail.
