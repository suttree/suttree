### 👋 I'm a maker and sometime digital art therapist, I lead teams who make products that people love, and create discrete, emotionally intelligent machines for your haus.


- 🤔 I've been a technical Director at Analog Folk, a Tech Lead at the V&A, a CTO and co-founder at Somewhere.com, a Creative Technologist at Made by Many, a CTO and co-founder at GameLayers, a games developer at 3rd Sense, an Analyst Programmer at UpMyStreet, and a junior developer at SelfTrade.

- 🧐 I speak javascript, ruby, python, perl, java, C#, C, and, er, COBOL. Years ago I learned to code on paper, through the postal service.

- ✨ I make procedural, abstract art pieces for the home, using processing, Unity, and python, with AI, object recognition and computer magic 🌈
- ✉️  I made an AI that lived in your inbox and read all the newsletters for you
- 🤖 I built a pirate radio station, run by robots
- 🐦 I made a digital companion, a bird called Ara
- ⚡ I made Somewhere.com, a creative community for sharing your work
- 🕹️ I made PMOG, a passively multiplayer online game
- 🥚 I once made a version of twitter with just the links, ma'am
- 🗺️ I once made a version of 4sq, without the people, or, er, the locations
- ❤️  I'm just an autotelic at heart
