### 👋 I'm a digital art therapist, I make discrete, emotionally intelligent machines for your haus.


- ✨ I make procedural, abstract art pieces
- ✉️  I made an AI that lived in your inbox and read all the newsletters for you
- 🤖 I built a pirate radio station, run by robots
- 🐦 I made a digital companion, a bird called Ara
- ⚡ I made Somewhere.com, a creative community for sharing your work
- 🕹️ I made PMOG, a passively multiplayer online game, after years of making my own flash and python games
- 🥚 I once made a version of twitter with just the links, m'aam
- 🗺️ I once made a version of 4sq, without the people, or, er, the locations
- ❤️  I'm just an autotelic at heart

Here's my portfolio, my other portfolio, and my other other portfolio.
