### 👋 &ensp;I'm a maker and sometime digital artist. I lead teams who make products that people love, and create discrete, emotionally intelligent machines for your haus.

I've been the Chief Product & Technology Office at Serco, Chief Technical Officer for the Liberal Democrats, Technical Director at Analog Folk, Head of Digital at The Moon Festival, a Tech Lead at the V&A, a founder at Somewhere.com, a Creative Technologist at Made by Many, a co-founder at GameLayers, a games developer at 3rd Sense, an Analyst Programmer at UpMyStreet, and a junior developer at SelfTrade. Phew.&ensp;🧐

🤔&ensp;I speak javascript, ruby, python, perl, java, C#, C, and, er, COBOL. Years ago I learned to code on graph paper, through the mail.
